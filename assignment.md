Data Types:

1)What are the primary data types in most programming languages?

Answer: The primary data types are integers, floating-point numbers, characters, and Booleans.

2)What is the difference between a float and a double data type?

Answer: Float and double are both used to represent floating-point numbers, but 'double' offers higher precision compared to 'float.'

3)What is the difference between value types and reference types in data types?

Answer: Value types hold their data directly, while reference types store a reference to the actual data. Value types include integers and Booleans, while reference types include objects and arrays.

4)Explain the concept of data type casting.

Answer: Data type casting is the process of converting a value from one data type to another, either implicitly or explicitly, to perform operations or assignments.

5)What is type inference in programming languages?

Answer: Type inference is the ability of a programming language to automatically deduce the data type of a variable based on its value.

Operators:

6)Differentiate between '==' and '===' operators in JavaScript.

Answer: '==' checks for equality of values, while '===' checks for equality of values and data types.

7)Explain the concept of short-circuiting in logical operators.

Answer: Short-circuiting in logical operators allows the program to skip the evaluation of the second condition if the first condition is sufficient to determine the overall outcome.

8)What is the purpose of the ternary operator in programming?

Answer: The ternary operator (?:) is used for conditional expressions, allowing you to write concise if-else statements in a single line.

Conditional Statements:

9)What is the difference between 'if', 'else if', and 'else' in conditional statements?

Answer: 'if' is used to specify the initial condition. 'else if' is used for additional conditions, and 'else' provides a fallback when no conditions are met.

10)What is a switch statement, and how does it differ from 'if-else' statements?

Answer: A switch statement is used to select one of many code blocks to be executed. It is typically used when you have multiple conditions to evaluate, making the code more readable compared to nested 'if-else' statements.

Looping Statements:

11)Explain the differences between 'for' and 'while' loops.

Answer: 'for' loops are used when the number of iterations is known, while 'while' loops are used when the condition for termination is evaluated before each iteration.

12)What is an infinite loop, and how can you avoid it?

Answer: An infinite loop is a loop that runs indefinitely. You can avoid it by ensuring that the loop's condition will eventually become false.

Functions:

13)What is a function in programming, and why is it important?

Answer: A function is a reusable block of code that performs a specific task. Functions promote code reusability and maintainability.

14)Explain the difference between function declarations and function expressions in JavaScript.

Answer: Function declarations are hoisted and can be called before they are defined, while function expressions are not hoisted and must be defined before they are called.

15)What is recursion, and how can it be useful in functions?

Answer: Recursion is a technique where a function calls itself. It's useful for solving problems that can be broken down into smaller, similar subproblems, such as factorial calculations and traversing tree structures.

16)What is function overloading?

Answer: Function overloading refers to the ability to define multiple functions with the same name but different parameter lists. The correct function to call is determined based on the number or types of arguments provided.
17)What is a higher-order function?

Answer: A higher-order function is a function that takes one or more functions as arguments or returns a function as its result. It is a fundamental concept in functional programming.
18)What is the "this" keyword in JavaScript and how does it work in functions?

Answer: In JavaScript, the this keyword refers to the current context. Its value can change depending on how a function is called, whether as a method, constructor, or standalone function.

19)How do you handle errors in a function?

Answer: Errors in functions can be handled using try...catch blocks to gracefully handle exceptions or by returning error codes or objects to indicate the presence of an error.
20)What is a lambda function (or anonymous function)?

Answer: A lambda function is a function without a name. It is often used for short, simple operations and is defined on the fly, usually as an argument to other functions.
